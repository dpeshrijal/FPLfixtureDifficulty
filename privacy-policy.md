# Privacy Policy â€“ FPL Fixture Difficulty Extension

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

It only interacts with publicly available Fantasy Premier League (FPL) APIs to enhance the user interface with fixture difficulty information. No personal, financial, or browsing data is accessed, stored, or shared.

The extension uses Chrome's `storage` API purely for local caching of fixture data for performance optimization.

If you have any questions, please contact [deepeshrijal@gmail.com].
